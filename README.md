With this understanding in place, the next step is to research industry trends and popular content types, ensuring the posts are relevant and timely. The content calendar is built by selecting various post categories, such as product promotions, lifestyle inspiration, user-generated content (UGC), influencer collaborations, sales announcements, and educational posts.

An Excel sheet is used to organize and manage the calendar, with each entry including details such as post date, content type, caption, hashtags, and visual ideas, making it easy to track progress. The process also involves reviewing and adjusting the calendar for consistency and alignment with Nykaa Fashion's overall marketing goals. By using an Excel sheet to plan and execute the strategy, Nykaa Fashion ensures that its social media presence remains cohesive, engaging, and effective in reaching its target audience, ultimately fostering a stronger connection with followers and driving business results.
